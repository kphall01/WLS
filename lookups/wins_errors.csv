"EventID","EventDescription"
"4096","WINS has initialized its log for this invocation."
"4097","WINS initialized properly and is now fully operational."
"4098","WINS was terminated by the service controller. WINS will gracefully terminate."
"4099","WINS is being gracefully terminated by the administrator. The address of the administrator is %1."
"4100","WINS is being abruptly terminated by the administrator. The address of the administrator is %1."
"4101","WINS received a Name Request with an invalid operation code. The request is being thrown away."
"4102","The connection was aborted by the remote WINS. Remote WINS may not be configured to replicate with the server."
"4103","There are no records in the registry for the key."
"4104","There are no pull records."
"4105","There are no push records."
"4106","The WINS database of name-to-address mappings is empty. It could mean that a previous invocation of WINS created the database and then went down before any registration could be done."
"4107","The WINS database of owner-to-address mappings is empty. It could mean that a previous invocation of WINS created the table and then went down before its own entry could be added. The WINS server went down very fast (even before all its threads could become fully operational)."
"4108","WINS could not read the InitTimeReplication field of the pull/push key."
"4109","WINS could not read the Refresh interval from the registry"
"4110","WINS could not read the Tombstone interval from the registry"
"4111","WINS could not read the Verify interval from the registry"
"4112","WINS could not read the retry count for retrying communication with a remote WINS."
"4113","WINS could not read the Tombstone Timeout from the registry."
"4114","WINS could not read the ConsistencyCheck value (type DWORD) from the Parameters\ConsistencyCheck subkey in the registry. The first consistency check is done at the time specified in the SpTime entry under the ConsistencyCheck subkey and is limited by the MaxRecsAtATime value. If the time is not specified, the check is done at 2 am."
"4115","WINS could not read the MaxRecsAtATime value (type DWORD) in the Wins\Parameters\ConsistencyCheck subkey of the registry. Set this value if you do not want WINS to replicate more than a set number of records in one cycle while doing periodic consistency checks of the WINS database. When doing a consistency check, WINS replicates all records of an owner WINS by either going to that WINS or to a replication partner. At the end of doing a consistency check for an owner's records, it checks to see if it has replicated more than the specified value in the current consistency check cycle. If the value has been exceeded, the consistency check stops, otherwise it continues. In the next cycle, it starts from where it left off and wraps around to the first owner if required."
"4116","WINS could not read the UseRplPnrs value of the Wins\Parameters\ConsistencyCheck key. If this value is set to a non-zero (DWORD) value, WINS will do a consistency check of the owners in its database by going to one or more of its replication partners. If the owner of the records happens to be a replication partner, WINS will go to it, otherwise it will pick one at random. Set this value if you have a large number of WINSs in your configuration and/or if you do not want the local WINS to go to any WINS that is not a replication partner."
"4117","WINS just did a consistency check on the records owned by the WINS with the address, %1. The number of records inserted, updated, and deleted are in the data section (second, third, fourth DWORDS)."
"4118","WINS could not do a consistency check on the records. This could be because WINS was directed to do the consistency check only with replication partners and it currently does not have any pull replication partners. To get around this problem, you should either allow WINS to do consistency check with owner WINSs or configure the WINS with one or more pull partners."
"4119","WINS received a packet that has the wrong format. For example, a label may be More than 63 octets."
"4120","No records meeting the %1 criteria were found in the WINS database."
"4121","WINS's Replicator could not find any records in the WINS database. This means there are no active or tombstone records in the database. It could be that the records being requested by a remote WINS server have either been released or do not exist."
"4122","The special group has reached its limit. WINS cannot add any more members."
"4123","The address database already has reached the limit of owners. This is 100. This error was noticed while attempting to add the address given in the data section."
"4124","The WINS server received an update notification from the non-configured WINS server at the address, %1. The WINS server rejected it. This means the remote WINS server is not in the list of Push partners (WINS servers under the Pull key) and the administrator has prohibited (using the registry) replication with non-configured WINS servers. If you want this WINS server to accept update notifications from non-configured WINS servers then set the Wins\Paramaters\RplOnlyWCnfPnrs value in the registry to 0."
"4125","WINS received an update notification from the WINS with the address, %1. WINS accepted it."
"4126","The WINS server received a pull request from the non-configured WINS server with the address, %1. The WINS server rejected it since the remote WINS server is not in the list of Pull partners (WINS servers under the Pull key) and the administrator has prohibited (using the registry) replication with non-configured partners. If you want this WINS server to accept update notifications from WINS servers not in the 'pull partner' list, then set the 'replication only with configured partners' value in the registry to 0."
"4127","The datafiles key could not be opened."
"4128","The NetBios over TCP/IP (NetBT) key could not be opened."
"4129","The NetBios over TCP/IP (NetBT) key could not be queried."
"4130","A worker thread was created by the administrator."
"4131","A worker thread was terminated by the administrator."
"4132","The owner-address mapping table had an entry with a non-zero owner ID and an address the same as the local WINS address. The entry has been marked as deleted in the in-memory table."
"4133","An error occurred while trying to inform a remote WINS to update the version number."
"4134","The local WINS is going to inform a remote WINS to update the version number of a record. This is because the local WINS encountered a conflict between an active owned name and an active replica that it pulled from a replication partner."
"4135","The local WINS has been informed by a remote WINS with address, %1, to update the version number of a record. This is because the remote WINS encountered a conflict between an active owned name and an active replica that it pulled from a replication partner."
"4136","A remote WINS requested the update of the version stamp of a record, but the record could not be found. Check to see if the record was deleted or updated."
"4137","A name mismatch was noticed while verifying the validity of old replicas. The local record has the name %1 while the replica pulled in from the WINS that owns this record has the name %2. This could mean that the remote WINS was brought down and then up again but its version counter value was not set to its previous value before termination."
"4138","The value of the version ID counter was changed. The new value (Low 32 bits) is given in the data section."
"4139","The WINS replication request is being ignored since WINS suspects that the Wins\Partners key information has changed (because it received a notification From the registry) which makes the current request pertaining to the partner out of date."
"4140","WINS is deleting all records of the WINS with owner ID, %d. This owner ID corresponds to the address, %s."
"4141","WINS pulled records from a WINS while doing %1. The partner's address and the owner's address whose records were pulled are given in the data section (second and third DWORD respectively). The number of records pulled is the fourth DWORD."
"4142","WINS performed a consistency check on the records. The number of records pulled, The address of the WINS whose records were pulled, and the address of the WINS from which these records were pulled are given in the second, third, and fourth DWORDs in the data section."
"4143","WINS scavenged its records in the WINS database. The number of records scavenged is given in the data section."
"4144","WINS scavenged replica tombstones in the WINS database. The number of records Scavenged is given in the data section."
"4145","WINS revalidated old active replicas in the WINS database."
"4146","WINS Performance Monitor Counters is closing the event log."
"4147","WINS has deleted records of a partner. The internal ID of the partner whose records were deleted, the minimum version number (low word, high word), and the maximum version number (low word, high word) of the records deleted are given in the data section."
"4148","The local WINS server received a request from a remote WINS server that is not the same version. Because the WINS servers are not compatible, the connection was terminated. The version number of the remote WINS server is given in the data section."
"4149","Winsock Send could not send all the bytes. The connection could have been aborted by the remote client."
"4150","WINS adjusted the scavenging related time interval, %1, so that it is compatible with the replication time intervals. The adjusted value for this scavenging parameter is given in the data section (second DWORD). This value was computed by WINS using an algorithm that may use the maximum replication time interval specified. The current value achieves a good balance between consistency of databases across the network of WINS servers and the performance of the WINS servers."
"4151","WINS adjusted the scavenging related time interval, %1. The adjusted value for this scavenging parameter is given in the data section (second DWORD). This value was computed by WINS using an algorithm that tries to achieve a good balance between consistency of databases across the network of WINS servers and the performance of the WINS servers."
"4152","The timeout period has expired on a call to another WINS server. Assuming that the network and routers are working properly, either the remote WINS server is overloaded, or its TCP listener thread has terminated."
"4153","The name registration packet that was just received has too many addresses. The maximum number of addresses for a multi-homed client is 25. The number of addresses found in the packet is given in the data section."
"4154","The name registration packet that was just received has too many addresses. The maximum number of addresses for a multi-homed client is 25. The number of addresses found in the packet is given in the data section."
"4155","A replica clashed with the static record, %1, in the WINS database. The replica was rejected."
"4156","WINS could not initialize the administrator interface because of a problem with the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service. You may not be able to administer WINS. Make sure that the RPC service is running."
"4157","WINS did not send a notification message to the WINS server whose address is given in the data section. There were a number of communications failures with that server in the past few minutes."
"4158","WINS received a release for the non-owned name, %1. This name is owned by the WINS whose owner ID is given in the data section. Run winscl.exe to get the owner ID to address mapping."
"4159","The administrator deleted a record with the name, %1."
"4160","WINS could not start because of a database error. WINS restored the old database from the backup directory and will come up using this database."
"4161","WINS received a release for the non-owned name, %1. This name is owned by the WINS whose owner ID is given in the data section. Run winscl.exe to get the owner ID to address mapping."
"4162","A partner has requested only a subset of records. This means we won't replicate all the records in the range requested. Check the partner's registry to see what replication type applies to it. The partner's address is given in the second DWORD of the data section."
"4163","WINS adjusted the Maximum Records at a time parameter of the ConsistencyCheck key. The value specified, %2, was changed to the minimum value, %1. These are the maximum number of records that will be replicated at any one time for a consistency check."
"4164","WINS was forced to scavenge replica tombstones of a WINS. The person with administrative rights on the computer forced the scavenging using winscl.exe."
"4165","WINS has encountered an error that caused it to shut down.The exception code is the second DWORD of the data section. Check previous event log entries to determine a more specific cause for the error."
"4166","The replication Pull thread is shutting down due to an error. Restart WINS."
"4167","The replication Push thread is shutting down due to an error. Restart WINS."
"4168","The Name Challenge thread is shutting down due to an error. Restart WINS."
"4169","A Worker thread is shutting down due to an error. Restart WINS."
"4170","An abnormal error occurred during the WINS initialization. Check the application and system logs for information on the cause. WINS may need to be restarted."
"4171","WINS could not properly set up the WINS database. Look at the application log for errors from the Exchange component, ESENT."

"4182","The registry change notification event could not be created. Check to see if system resources are low."
"4183","The correct time format is hh:mm:ss. Check the value of SpTime in the registry."
"4184","The registry notification function returned an error."
"4185","The Name Registration Response could not be sent due to an error. This error was encountered by a NetBT request thread"
"4186","The Name Registration Response could not be sent due to an error. This error was encountered by a RPL thread."
"4187","The Name Registration Response could not be sent due to an error. This error was encountered by the Name Challenge Thread."
"4188","The Name Release Response could not be sent due to an error. This error is often caused by a problem with the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) interface."
"4189","The Name Query Response could not be sent due to an error. This error is often caused by a problem with the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) interface."
"4190","A record could not be registered because it already existed. However, the same record then could not be found. The WINS database might be corrupt. Check the application log for the Exchange component, ESENT."
"4191","WINS could not create a heap because of a resource shortage. Check to see if the computer is running short of virtual memory."
"4192","An error occurred from which WINS will try to recover. If the recovery fails, check previous event log entries to determine what prevented a successful recovery. Take the appropriate action to solve the error that prevented recovery."
"4193","WINS could not create the notification socket. Make sure the TCP/IP driver is installed and running properly."
"4194","WINS could not create the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket to listen for Connection notification messages sent by another Pull thread in the local WINS."

"4198","WINS could not listen on the Winsock socket."
"4199","Winsock Select returned with an error."
"4200","%1 returned with an error code of %2."
"4201","WINS created a socket and called the 'bind' WinSock API to bind a handle to it. On calling 'getsockname' to determine the address bound, WINS received an error."
"4202","An attempt to connect to the remote WINS server with address %1 returned with an error. Check to see that the remote WINS server is running and available, and that WINS is running on that server."
"4203","WINS could not accept on a socket."
"4204","WINS could not read from the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket."
"4205","WINS could not read from NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT)."

"4209","A Winsock Sendto message returned with an error."
"4210","The Winsock receive function returned with an unexpected error."
"4211","The WinSock send function returned with an unexpected error."
"4212","A message was received on an association. The association is in a bad state. This indicates a bug in the WINS code. Restart WINS."
"4213","WINS could not allocate a responder association. Check to see if the system is low on resources."
"4214","WINS could not allocate an initiator association. Check to see if the system is low on resources."
"4215","WINS could not allocate an implicit dialogue. Check to see if the system is low on resources."
"4216","WINS could not allocate an explicit dialogue. Check to see if the system is low on resources."
"4217","WINS could not look up the association block for a NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) association. Check to see if the message read is corrupted. WINS looks at bit 11-14 of the message to determine if the association is from another WINS or from an NetBT node. It is possible that the bits are corrupted or that there is a mismatch between what the two WINS servers expect to see in those bits."
"4218","WINS could not allocate a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Buffer. Check to see if the system is low on resources."

"4222","A WINS thread could not signal a handle."
"4223","A WINS thread could not reset a handle."
"4224","WINS encountered a database error. This may or may not be a serious error. WINS will try to recover from it. You can check the database error events under 'Application Log' category of the Event Viewer for the Exchange Component, ESENT, source to find out more details about database errors."
"4225","WINS could not update the record with the name, %1. Check the application log for the Exchange component, ESENT."
"4226","WINS could not update the Owner ID-to-Address mapping table in the database. This means the in-memory table that maps to the database table has gotten out of sync with the database table."
"4227","The Push Thread was requested for a range of records but could not find any records in the range. Make sure that the replication time intervals are set properly. If the tombstone interval and timeout intervals are not correct (that is, much less than the replication interval), the above condition is possible. This is because the records might get changed into tombstones and then deleted before the remote WINS can pull them. Similarly, if the refresh interval is set to be much less than the replication interval then the records could get released before a WINS can pull them (a released record is not sent)."
"4228","The Timer thread could not be signaled. This indicates this computer is extremely overloaded or that the WINS application has failed. Check for low system resources. It may be necessary to restart WINS."

"4253","WINS did not find any subkeys under the Push key."
"4254","An error has prevented WINS from updating the WINS database. The database may be corrupt."
"4255","WINS has been asked to pull entries from itself. Check all the Pull subkeys of this WINS."
"4256","WINS was unable to propagate the push trigger."
"4257","WINS sent a name query or a name release with a certain transaction ID. It received a response to the request that differed either in the name that it contained or in the operation code. WINS has thrown the response away."
"4258","The WINS database is inconsistent. The number of owners found in the name-address mapping table are different from the number found in the owner-address mapping table."
"4259","The local WINS requested a remote WINS to update the version number of a database record owned by the remote WINS. The remote WINS could not do the update and reported an error."
"4260","WINS received an error while registering replicas. It will not register any additional replicas of this WINS at this time (the address is in the data section 4th-8th byte). Check a previous log entry to determine the reason for this. If you get the same error during subsequent replication with the above partner WINS, you may want to restore the WINS database from the backup."

"4278","WINS could not do a static initialization."
"4279","An error occurred during the configuration or reconfiguration of WINS. If this was encountered during boot time, WINS will come up with default parameters. You may want to research the cause of this initialization failure and then reboot WINS."
"4280","An error occurred during the configuration or reconfiguration of WINS."
"4281","A lock error has occurred. This could happen if the WINS is trying to send a response on a dialogue that is no longer ACTIVE. An implicit dialogue can cease to exist if the association it is mapped to terminates. In this case, getting a lock error is normal."
"4282","WINS could not import static mappings from the file, %1. Verify that the file exists and is readable."
"4283","WINS encountered an error while processing a push trigger or update notification. The error code is given in the data section. If it indicates a communication failure, check to see if the remote WINS that sent the trigger went down. If the remote WINS is on a different subnet, then maybe the router is down."
"4284","WINS encountered an exception while processing a pull trigger."
"4285","WINS encountered an exception while retrieving data records."
"4286","The WINS server cannot make or accept this connection since the connections limit has been reached. This situation is temporary and should resolve by itself shortly."
"4287","The exception was encountered during the processing of a group member."
"4288","The Scavenger thread encountered an error while cleaning up the owner-address table. It will try again after the Verify interval has elapsed."
"4289","WINS is trying to update the version number of a database record that it does not own. This is a serious error if the WINS server is updating the record after a conflict. It is not a serious error if the WINS server is updating the record as a result of a request to do so from a remote WINS server (When a remote WINS server notices a conflict between an active owned entry and a replica it informs the owner of the replica to update the version number of the record. It is possible that the replica is no longer owned by the remote WINS)."

"4291","WINS tried to get its addresses but failed. WINS will recover when the IP address comes back."
"4292","WINS did not get back any names from NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) when it did an adapter status."
"4293","WINS could not initialize properly with the security subsystem. At initialization, WINS creates a security object and attaches an Access Control List (ACL) to it. This security object is then used to authenticate Remote Procedure Call (RPC) calls made to WINS. WINS could not create the above security object."
"4294","The client application does not have the permissions required to execute the function."
"4295","When WINS replicated with its partners, one of the partners showed there was more data that actually existed. WINS adjusted its counter so that new registrations and updates are seen by its partners. This means that recovery did not work properly. You may want to check which of the partners has the highest version number corresponding to the local WINS. Shut down WINS and restart after specifying this number in the registry."
"4296","Too many concurrent static initializations are occurring. The number of such initializations currently active is given in the data section. This could be caused by reinitialization or imports from the WINS Manager tool. Try to initialize again."
"4297","WINS encountered a low memory condition. Check to see if the system is running out of virtual memory."
"4298","WINS found some database corruption. The record named, %1, is corrupt. It could be that recovery from the last crash did not work properly. WINS will try to recover. You may decide, however, to restore the WINS database from the backup."
"4299","The following name, %1, is too long. Valid NetBios names must not exceed 15 characters. The name has not been entered in the WINS database."
"4300","The record with the name, %1, has bad address. It has not been entered in the WINS database."
"4301","The computer running the WINS server does not have a valid address. When WINS requested an address, it received 0.0.0.0 as the address."
"4302","WINS encountered an error doing a database backup to directory %1."
"4303","WINS encountered an error while deleting the file, %1."
"4304","WINS encountered an error while deleting one or more records of a WINS. The WINS address is in the second DWORD in data section. Check a previous log entry to determine what went wrong."
"4305","WINS encountered an error while getting the browser names for a client."
"4306","The length of the message sent by another WINS indicates a very big message. There may have been corruption of the data. WINS will ignore this message, terminate the connection with the remote WINS, and continue."
"4307","The WINS replicator Pull thread encountered an error while processing a request. Check other log entries to determine what went wrong."

"4311","WINS has found some database corruption. It will try to recover. This recovery process can take a long time. Do not kill WINS in the middle of the recovery. If you do, you will have to restart WINS with a clean database."
"4312","WINS has exceeded the wait time for all threads to terminate. The number of threads still active is given in the second DWORD of the data section. The thread that could be stuck is the replicator thread. It could be because of the other WINS being slow in sending data or reading data. The latter can contribute to back-pressure on the TCP connection on which it is trying to replicate."
"4313","The name, %1, is in the wrong format. It has not been put in the WINS database. Check to see if you have a space before the name. If you want this space in the name, enclose the name within quotes."

"4319","WINS could not start because the existent database must be converted to the Windows 2000 format. If this is the first invocation of WINS after an upgrade From NT3.51, you need to run the convert utility (upg351db.exe in the %%SystemRoot%%\system32 directory) on the WINS database to convert it to the new database format. Once you have done that, you should restart WINS."
"4320","WINS will not start because the existing WINS database needs to be converted to the Windows 2000 format. WINS has initiated this conversion using a process called JETCONV.

"4337","The WINS Server could not initialize security to allow the read-only operations."
"4338","The WINS server started the burst handling of incoming requests. WINS does this to handle a sudden increase of incoming requests. WINS will also log an event indicating when the burst handling stops. If you see this event frequently, you may want to upgrade the WINS server to a faster computer. You can also try to adjust the burst handling count using the WINS Manager tool."
"4339","The WINS server completed the burst handling of incoming requests because the queue length became a quarter of what it was when burst handling began."
