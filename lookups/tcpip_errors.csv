"4101","Unable to allocate required resources. Initialization failed."
"4196","Failed to initialize IP."
"4225","Initialization of TCP/UDP failed."
"4227","TCP/IP failed to establish an outgoing connection because the selected local endpoint was recently used to connect to the same remote endpoint. This error typically occurs when outgoing connections are opened and closed at a high rate, causing all available local ports to be used and forcing TCP/IP to reuse a local port for an outgoing connection. To minimize the risk of data corruption, the TCP/IP standard requires a minimum time period to elapse between successive connections from a given local endpoint to a given remote endpoint."
"4228","TCP/IP has chosen to restrict the scale factor due to a network condition. This could be related to a problem in a network device and will cause degraded throughput."
"9001","%2 could not allocate a resource of type %3 due to system resource problems."

"4191","IP could not open the registry key for network adapter %2. Interfaces on this network adapter will not be initialized."
"4192","Invalid default gateway address %2 was specified for network adapter %3. Some remote networks may not be reachable as a result."

"4194","Unable to read the configured subnet masks for network adapter %2. IP interfaces will not be initialized on this network adapter."
"4197","More than the maximum number of default gateways were specified for network adapter %2. Some remote networks may not be reachable as a result."
"4198","The system detected an address conflict for IP address %2 with the system having network hardware address %3. The local interface has been disabled."
"4199","The system detected an address conflict for IP address %2 with the system having network hardware address %3. Network operations on this system may be disrupted as a result."
"4200","Unable to read or write the NTE Context list for network adapter %2. IP interfaces on this network adapter may not be initialized completely."
"4202","The system detected that network adapter %2 was disconnected from the network and its network configuration has been released. If the network adapter was not disconnected, this may indicate that it has malfunctioned. Try updating the network adapter's drivers."
"9006","%2 could not find network adapter %3."
"9008","%2 failed while querying OID %3 on network adapter %4."
